# CNN-Models
I used Google Colab to practice and understand convolution operations. 
This powerful tool has been instrumental in visualizing and experimenting with various convolution techniques, which are the backbone of computer vision tasks.
This project involved replicating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images based on preset values. 
This practical approach has significantly enhanced my understanding of how CNNs function, including the intricacies of:
Convolutional layers
Pooling layers
Activation functions
Fully connected layers
CNNs are a game-changer in the field of computer vision, enabling machines to identify and categorize images with remarkable accuracy. 
Tools & Technologies:
Google Colab: For coding and experimentation
Python: Programming language
TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning frameworks
